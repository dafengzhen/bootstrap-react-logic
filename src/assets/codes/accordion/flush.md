```jsx
<Accordion
  flush
  options={[
    {
      collapsed: true,
      show: false,
      header: 'Accordion Item #1',
      body: (
        <>
          Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to demonstrate the
          <code>.accordion-flush</code> class. This is the first item's accordion body.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      collapsed: true,
      show: false,
      header: 'Accordion Item #2',
      body: (
        <>
          Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to demonstrate the
          <code>.accordion-flush</code> class. This is the second item's accordion body. Let's imagine this being filled
          with some actual content.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      collapsed: true,
      show: false,
      header: 'Accordion Item #3',
      body: (
        <>
          Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to demonstrate the
          <code>.accordion-flush</code> class. This is the third item's accordion body. Nothing more exciting happening
          here in terms of content, but just filling up the space to make it look, at least at first glance, a bit more
          representative of how this would look in a real-world application.
        </>
