  "p3": "On the other hand, the dropOldClass and variables properties are more practical.",
  "p4": "The dropOldClass property can remove the base class names. For example, <Button className=\"btn btn-info\"> would be modified to <Button className=\"btn-info\">.",
  "p5": "Meanwhile, the variables property allows us to customize CSS variables, enhancing the flexibility of styles.\n"
