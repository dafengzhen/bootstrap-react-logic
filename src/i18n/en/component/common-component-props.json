  "p0": "The 'as' property allows you to specify the element type or custom component that should be rendered.",
  "p1": "This provides flexibility when you want a component to render something other than its default tag. For instance, you can render a button as an 'a' (anchor) tag, or any other valid element.",
  "p2": "The use of the render and skipCompWrap properties isn't very meaningful.",
  "p3": "Just think about it, the purpose of using a component library is to simplify development, not to rewrite components.",
  "p4": "On the other hand, the dropOldClass and variables properties are more practical.",
  "p5": "The dropOldClass property can remove the base class names. For example, <Button className=\"btn btn-info\"> would be modified to <Button className=\"btn-info\">.",
  "p6": "Meanwhile, the variables attribute allows us to use bootstrap variables that start with 'bs' and custom CSS variables, enhancing styling flexibility"
