# Contribution Guide

We welcome contributions through submitting PRs and reporting issues!

## Reporting Issues

Please note the following when reporting issues:

1. **Responding to Verification Requests**: For unclear or unverifiable issues, if the author does not respond to the verification request within 7 days, the issue will be closed.
2. **Technical Challenges**: For issues that cannot be resolved or require technical expertise beyond reach, the issue will remain open, hoping someone from the community can contribute a PR to resolve it.

## Testing

To expedite the addition of new components in the early stages, unit tests might be overlooked. This will be improved in subsequent versions.

## Component Design

Please follow these design principles:

1. **Consistency**: Ensure consistency with the overall library style and API design.
2. **Simplicity and Optimization**: Keep components simple and optimize them where possible.

## Accessibility

In the initial stages, default values and accessibility considerations may have been neglected to prioritize feature expansion. This will be addressed in future updates.

## Documentation

Any API changes must be accompanied by documentation updates. Ensure code and documentation are always in sync to facilitate user understanding and usage.

## Breaking Changes

1. **Deprecation Notice**: All breaking changes must include clear deprecation notices to inform users about the affected functionality.
2. **Compatibility Handling**: Deprecated APIs will be completely removed in subsequent versions, with no backward compatibility retained.

Thank you for your contributions!
